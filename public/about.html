    <h2>HELLO I AM <span class="name">GHAYATHRI</span></h2>
    <p>A <span class="name">Computer Science</span> student with a strong passion for <span class="name">full-stack development</span> and a deep curiosity for emerging technologies.

From building responsive front-end interfaces to designing robust back-end systems, I enjoy working across the entire tech stack to bring ideas to life. I’ve gained <span class="name">hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB,</span> and I’m continuously expanding my skills in frameworks like Next.js and tools like Docker and Git.

What excites me most is how fast technology evolves — from AI and cloud computing to blockchain and Web3. I thrive on learning and adapting, and I’m always exploring ways to use modern tools to solve real-world problems.

Currently, I’m focused on strengthening my full-stack development skills, contributing to open-source projects, and building a portfolio that reflects my growth and interests in tech.

Outside of coding, I enjoy participating in hackathons, reading about tech trends, and collaborating with others who are just as enthusiastic about technology as I am.

Let’s connect and build something impactful!
